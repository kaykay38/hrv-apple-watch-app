# Heart Rate Variability

## Nervous System
- Parasympathetic
- Sympathetic

## Data Sampling/Metrics
About 15hr battery life<br>
Sample rate?<br>
Sample infrequently as possible

Machine learning to adapt to each person's HRV<br>
Gather information in the background to build the machine learning model<br>

## Data Manipulation/Predictions
Calculate from historical stored heart rate data to establish average, high, low?<br>
Activity tracking? i.e. picking up children<br>
Time of day.<br>
Highest HRV at night

## UI
- Color scale
- Average
- High
- Low

## Alert
Alert **before** danger threshold<br>
Alert as early as possible<br>
Pulse? Sound? Should be intrusive<br>
Ask if user is stressed yes/no for gathering data to understand user's average, high, low HRV?<br>
Figuring out optimum HRV to alert user<br>
Emergency contact?

## Data Storage
- **iOS App** -- It would be good to have a companion iOS app for data storage and historical data tracking and visualization in day, week, months like the health app. We may be able implement it in the existing health app infrastructure unless we think it will be better as a standalone.
